# Fix: Password Reset Token Generation Issue

Date: 2025-03-15

## Description of Changes

We identified and fixed a critical issue with the password reset functionality. The problem was that the system was using the regular JWT token generation method instead of the specialized password reset token method, which was causing token validation to fail during the password reset process.

### Key Changes:

1. **Updated `UserService.ForgotPasswordAsync` method**

The main fix was changing the token generation method from `GenerateJwtToken` to `GeneratePasswordResetToken` in the `ForgotPasswordAsync` method:

```csharp
// Before:
var token = _jwtTokenService.GenerateJwtToken(user);

// After:
var token = _jwtTokenService.GeneratePasswordResetToken(user);
```

This change ensures that the password reset token includes the special "purpose" claim that identifies it as a password reset token:

```csharp
// From JwtTokenService.GeneratePasswordResetToken
public string GeneratePasswordResetToken(User user)
{
    // ... token configuration ...
    
    var tokenDescriptor = new SecurityTokenDescriptor
    {
        Subject = new ClaimsIdentity(
            new[]
            {
                new Claim(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, user.Id.ToString()),
                new Claim(ClaimTypes.Email, user.Email),
                new Claim("purpose", "password_reset") // Special purpose claim
            }
        ),
        // Password reset tokens should expire after a short time
        Expires = DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(1), // 1 hour expiration
        // ... other token settings ...
    };
    
    // ... token creation ...
}
```

2. **Enhanced logging in `AuthController.ResetPassword`**

The controller already had detailed logging that helped identify the issue:

```csharp
Log.Information("Token comparison - Expected: {Expected}, Received: {Received}", 
    user.ForgotPasswordToken, 
    command.Token);
    
if (user.ForgotPasswordToken != command.Token)
{
    Log.Warning("Password reset failed: Token mismatch for email: {Email}. Expected: {Expected}, Received: {Received}", 
        command.Email, user.ForgotPasswordToken, command.Token);
    return BadRequest(new { message = "Invalid token" });
}
```

## Impact

This fix resolves the token mismatch issue that was preventing users from successfully resetting their passwords. The following areas are directly impacted:

1. **Password Reset Flow** - Users can now successfully complete the password reset process
2. **Security** - Proper token generation with specific purpose claims enhances security
3. **User Experience** - Reduces frustration from failed password reset attempts

## Files Affected

- `ASafariM.Infrastructure/Services/UserService.cs` - Updated the `ForgotPasswordAsync` method to use the correct token generation method
- `ASafariM.Application/Services/JwtTokenService.cs` - Utilized the existing `GeneratePasswordResetToken` method
- `ASafariM.Presentation/Controllers/AuthController.cs` - Leveraged existing validation and logging

## Testing

The fix was tested through the following steps:

1. **Request Password Reset** - Verified that the system generates the correct token type
2. **Email Delivery** - Confirmed that the reset link contains the properly formatted token
3. **Token Validation** - Tested that the backend correctly validates the specialized token
4. **Password Update** - Verified that users can successfully update their password after token validation

The logs show that the token comparison now succeeds, and users can complete the password reset process without encountering the "Invalid token" error.
