# Project Service and Repository Update

Date: 2025-03-05

Git Commit Hash: 328ea7a08605ffdeabb18314214c2a457e8a5fa8

## Description of Changes:

### 1. Refactoring `ProjectService`

- • **Change**: Refactored `ProjectService` to utilize `AppDbContext` directly instead of `IProjectRepository` for CRUD operations.

- • **Reason**: This change simplifies the service layer by removing the dependency on the repository interface for basic CRUD operations, allowing for direct access to the database context.

```csharp
  public class ProjectService : IProjectService
  {
      private readonly AppDbContext _dbContext;

      public ProjectService(AppDbContext dbContext)
      {
          _dbContext = dbContext;
      }
  }
```

### 2. Added Methods to `IProjectRepository`
- • **Change**: Added methods for fetching projects with members and handling bulk deletions:
  - `GetByIdWithMembersAsync`
  - `GetAllWithMembersAsync`
  - `GetByIdsAsync`
  - `DeleteManyAsync`
- • **Reason**: These methods provide more efficient data retrieval and manipulation capabilities, allowing for better handling of project-related operations.

```csharp
public async Task<Project> GetByIdWithMembersAsync(Guid id)
{
    return await _dbContext.Projects.Include(p => p.ProjectMembers).FirstOrDefaultAsync(p => p.Id == id);
}
```

### 3. Updated `ProjectsController`
- • **Change**: Updated the `ProjectsController` to reflect changes in service methods and improve logging:
  - Changed method calls to `GetAllAsync`, `GetByIdAsync`, `CreateAsync`, and `UpdateAsync`.
- • **Reason**: Aligning the controller with the new service methods ensures that the API endpoints function correctly and utilize the latest logic implemented in the service layer.

```csharp
var projects = await _projectService.GetAllAsync();
var project = await _projectService.GetByIdAsync(id);
var project = await _projectService.GetByIdWithMembersAsync(id);
var project = await _projectService.CreateAsync(request);
var project = await _projectService.UpdateAsync(id, request);
```

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging
- • **Change**: Enhanced error handling and logging in the `ProjectService` methods:
  - Added detailed logging for project creation, updates, and deletions.
  - Implemented null checks and validation for incoming requests.
- • **Reason**: Improved error handling and logging provide better visibility into application behavior and help identify issues more quickly during development and production.

```csharp
if (project == null)
{
    _logger.Warning($"Project with ID {id} not found");
    throw new NotFoundException($"Project with ID {id} not found");
}
```

## Impact:
- • Improved maintainability and readability of project-related code.
- • Enhanced logging for better debugging and monitoring of project operations.
- • Streamlined project retrieval processes with eager loading of related members.

## Files Affected:
- • `ASafariM.Infrastructure.Services.ProjectService`
- • `ASafariM.Domain.Interfaces.IProjectRepository`
- • `ASafariM.Presentation.Controllers.ProjectsController`

## Testing:
- • Ensure that all CRUD operations for projects work as expected.
- • Ensure that projects can be fetched with their associated members.
- • Confirm that bulk deletions function correctly and log appropriate messages.
- • Run all unit tests to ensure code coverage is sufficient and all tests pass.
