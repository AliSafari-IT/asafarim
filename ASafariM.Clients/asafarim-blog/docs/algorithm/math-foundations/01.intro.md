# Mathematical Foundations of Algorithms

## Why Mathematics Matters in Algorithms

Algorithms and mathematics are deeply intertwined. Mathematical concepts provide:

1. **Precision** in algorithm specification
2. **Frameworks** for analyzing algorithm efficiency
3. **Tools** for proving correctness
4. **Language** for expressing computational complexity

Understanding these mathematical foundations is essential for designing efficient algorithms and solving complex computational problems.

## Key Mathematical Concepts

### 1. Functions and Growth Rates

Functions describe relationships between inputs and outputs, crucial for analyzing how algorithm performance scales with input size.

#### Important Function Classes:

| Function Class | Growth Rate | Example in Algorithms |
|----------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Constant | O(1) | Accessing an array element |
| Logarithmic | O(log n) | Binary search |
| Linear | O(n) | Finding the maximum in an unsorted array |
| Linearithmic | O(n log n) | Merge sort, heapsort |
| Quadratic | O(n²) | Simple comparison-based sorting algorithms |
| Polynomial | O(nᵏ) | Many dynamic programming solutions |
| Exponential | O(cⁿ) | Exhaustive search |
| Factorial | O(n!) | Generating all permutations |

#### Example: Growth Rate Comparison

```javascript
// Calculating the sum from 1 to n
// O(n) implementation - Linear
function linearSum(n) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sum += i;
  }
  return sum;
}

// O(1) implementation - Constant
function constantSum(n) {
  return (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
}

// For n = 1,000,000:
// linearSum: ~1,000,000 operations
// constantSum: ~1 operation
```

### 2. Sets, Relations, and Graphs

Sets form the foundation of many data structures, while relations help model connections between entities.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Sets**: Collections of distinct objects
- **Relations**: Connections between elements of sets
- **Graphs**: Structures consisting of vertices and connecting edges
- **Trees**: Special graphs with no cycles

#### Example: Graph Representation

```javascript
// Adjacency list representation of a graph
const graph = {
  A: ['B', 'C'],
  B: ['A', 'D', 'E'],
  C: ['A', 'F'],
  D: ['B'],
  E: ['B', 'F'],
  F: ['C', 'E']
};

// Finding all neighbors of a vertex
function getNeighbors(vertex) {
  return graph[vertex] || [];
}

console.log(getNeighbors('B')); // Output: ['A', 'D', 'E']
```

### 3. Combinatorics

Combinatorics deals with counting and arrangement of objects, essential for analyzing algorithm complexity and designing algorithms for permutation problems.

#### Important Concepts:

- **Permutations**: Arrangements of objects where order matters
- **Combinations**: Selections of objects where order doesn't matter
- **Binomial Coefficients**: Number of ways to choose k items from n items
- **Pigeonhole Principle**: If n+1 items are placed in n containers, at least one container has multiple items

#### Example: Calculating Combinations

```javascript
// Calculate binomial coefficient (n choose k)
function binomialCoefficient(n, k) {
  if (k < 0 || k > n) return 0;
  if (k === 0 || k === n) return 1;
  
  // Dynamic programming approach using Pascal's triangle
  const dp = Array(n + 1).fill(0).map(() => Array(k + 1).fill(0));
  
  for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j <= Math.min(i, k); j++) {
      if (j === 0 || j === i) {
        dp[i][j] = 1;
      } else {
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j];
      }
    }
  }
  
  return dp[n][k];
}

// Number of ways to select 3 elements from a set of 5 elements
console.log(binomialCoefficient(5, 3)); // Output: 10
```

### 4. Summations and Recurrence Relations

Summations and recurrences are fundamental in analyzing the running time of recursive algorithms.

#### Common Summations in Algorithm Analysis:

- **Arithmetic Series**: sum(i=1 to n) i = n(n+1)/2 = Θ(n²)
- **Geometric Series**: sum(i=0 to n-1) r^i = (1-r^n)/(1-r) for r≠1
- **Harmonic Series**: sum(i=1 to n) 1/i = Θ(log n)

#### Example: Solving a Recurrence Relation

The recurrence relation for Merge Sort's time complexity:

T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(n)

Using the Master Theorem, this resolves to Θ(n log n).

```javascript
// Merge Sort implementation demonstrating the recurrence relation
function mergeSort(arr) {
  // Base case: arrays of length 0 or 1 are already sorted
  if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;
  
  // Divide: Split the input array in half - T(n/2) for each half
  const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
  const left = mergeSort(arr.slice(0, mid));
  const right = mergeSort(arr.slice(mid));
  
  // Conquer: Merge the sorted halves - Θ(n) operation
  return merge(left, right);
}

function merge(left, right) {
  const result = [];
  let leftIndex = 0;
  let rightIndex = 0;
  
  // Compare elements and merge
  while (leftIndex < left.length && rightIndex < right.length) {
    if (left[leftIndex] < right[rightIndex]) {
      result.push(left[leftIndex]);
      leftIndex++;
    } else {
      result.push(right[rightIndex]);
      rightIndex++;
    }
  }
  
  // Add remaining elements
  return result.concat(
    left.slice(leftIndex),
    right.slice(rightIndex)
  );
}
```

### 5. Probability in Algorithms

Probability concepts enable the design and analysis of randomized algorithms, which often provide efficient solutions to complex problems.

#### Key Applications:

- **Quicksort**: Average-case analysis depends on random pivot selection
- **Hashing**: Performance analysis relies on probability of collisions
- **Monte Carlo Algorithms**: Probabilistic solutions with bounded error
- **Las Vegas Algorithms**: Randomized algorithms that always give correct answers

#### Example: Randomized Selection of Pivot in Quicksort

```javascript
function quicksort(arr, low = 0, high = arr.length - 1) {
  if (low < high) {
    // Randomized partition
    const pivotIndex = randomPartition(arr, low, high);
    
    // Recursively sort elements before and after partition
    quicksort(arr, low, pivotIndex - 1);
    quicksort(arr, pivotIndex + 1, high);
  }
  return arr;
}

function randomPartition(arr, low, high) {
  // Randomly select a pivot to improve average-case performance
  const randomPivotIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * (high - low + 1)) + low;
  
  // Swap the randomly selected pivot with the last element
  [arr[randomPivotIndex], arr[high]] = [arr[high], arr[randomPivotIndex]];
  
  return partition(arr, low, high);
}

function partition(arr, low, high) {
  const pivot = arr[high];
  let i = low - 1;
  
  for (let j = low; j < high; j++) {
    if (arr[j] <= pivot) {
      i++;
      [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]];
    }
  }
  
  [arr[i + 1], arr[high]] = [arr[high], arr[i + 1]];
  return i + 1;
}
```

## Mathematical Proof Techniques

Proving algorithm correctness and efficiency requires mathematical reasoning:

### 1. Direct Proof

Used to prove statements of the form "if P then Q" by assuming P and showing Q follows logically.

### 2. Proof by Contradiction

Assumes the opposite of what needs to be proven and shows it leads to a contradiction.

### 3. Mathematical Induction

Essential for proving properties of algorithms operating on recursively defined data structures:

1. **Base Case**: Prove the property holds for the smallest instance
2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the property holds for all instances up to n, then prove it holds for n+1

#### Example: Proving Correctness of Binary Search

```
Theorem: Binary search correctly finds an element in a sorted array.

Proof by Induction:
  Base case: For an array of size 1, binary search directly compares the single element.
  
  Inductive hypothesis: Assume binary search works for all arrays of size k where 1 ≤ k < n.
  
  Inductive step: For an array of size n, binary search compares the middle element.
    - If it's the target, we're done
    - If target < middle element, binary search is called on the left subarray (size ≤ n/2)
    - If target > middle element, binary search is called on the right subarray (size ≤ n/2)
  
  By our inductive hypothesis, binary search correctly works on these smaller subarrays.
  Therefore, binary search works for arrays of size n.
```

## Applied Math in Common Algorithm Paradigms

### 1. Divide and Conquer

Uses recurrence relations to analyze time complexity:

T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)

where:
- a = number of subproblems
- n/b = size of each subproblem
- f(n) = cost of dividing and combining

### 2. Dynamic Programming

Relies on:
- **Optimal Substructure**: Optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems
- **Overlapping Subproblems**: Same subproblems are solved multiple times

### 3. Greedy Algorithms

Requires mathematical proof of:
- **Greedy Choice Property**: Locally optimal choices lead to a globally optimal solution
- **Optimal Substructure**: Similar to dynamic programming
