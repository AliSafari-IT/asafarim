* **cfce7da** - Updated delete user functionality to match backend API requirements
  - Improved the delete user process to send the user ID in the request body, aligning with the backend API expectations.
  - Enhanced error handling to provide clearer messages for different error scenarios, such as user not found.
  - Code snippet:
  ```typescript
  // Delete a user by ID
  export const deleteUser = async (id: string): Promise<void> => {
    const deleteUrl = `${USERS_URL}`;
    console.log("deleteUser - URL:", deleteUrl);
    try {
      const response = await axios.delete(deleteUrl, {
        data: id, // Send ID directly as the request body
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
      });
      if (response.status !== 204) { // NoContent status code
        throw new Error('Failed to delete user')
      }
      console.log("User deleted successfully:", id);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error in deleteUser:', error);
      if (axios.isAxiosError(error)) {
        if (error.response?.status === 404) {
          throw new Error('User not found')
        }
        throw new Error(error.response?.data?.message || 'Failed to delete user')
      }
      throw error
    }
  }
  ```
