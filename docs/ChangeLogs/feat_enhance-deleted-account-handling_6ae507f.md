Created: 2025-02-14
Type: Feature & Refactor
Author: asafarim_it_1

## Description of Changes

### 1. Backend Changes
Added explicit deleted account check in AuthController:

```csharp
// Check if account is deleted
if (user.IsDeleted == true)
{
    Log.Warning("Login attempt for deleted account. User ID: {UserId}, Email: {Email}", 
        user.Id, command.Email);
    return new ObjectResult(new { 
        message = "This account has been deleted.", 
        isDeleted = true 
    })
    {
        StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status403Forbidden,
    };
}
```

### 2. Frontend UI Improvements
Enhanced DeletedAccountMessage component with modern design:
```tsx
<div className="fixed inset-0 bg-gray-600 bg-opacity-50 overflow-y-auto h-full w-full flex items-center justify-center">
  <div className="relative mx-auto p-8 w-full max-w-md bg-white rounded-lg shadow-2xl transform transition-all">
    <div className="text-center">
      {/* Warning Icon */}
      <div className="mx-auto flex items-center justify-center h-16 w-16 rounded-full bg-red-100 mb-6">
        <svg className="h-10 w-10 text-red-600" /* ... */ />
      </div>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Account Deleted</h2>
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### 3. Error Handling
Updated LoginPage to handle deleted account responses:
```typescript
if (auth.user?.isDeleted) {
  logger.info('Attempted login to deleted account');
  setShowDeletedMessage(true);
  return;
}
```

### 4. Logging Improvements
Added comprehensive logging for deleted account scenarios:
```typescript
logger.info('Reactivation request sent successfully');
logger.error('Failed to send reactivation request:'+ JSON.stringify(err));
```

## Impact
- Login flow now properly handles deleted accounts
- Users receive clear feedback when attempting to log in to a deleted account
- Account reactivation process is more user-friendly
- Improved error tracking and debugging capabilities
