Sometimes, an analytical tool require a `Linux Operating System`. In such case, maybe you need to set up a virtual machine (VM), in order to install and work with a linux based software.\r\n\r\n Fortunately, by having the Internet and googling in you side, you can have access to a lot of open source packages and shared repositories that are developed by both researchers and professional developers. \r\n\r\n Nowadays, as a researcher if you want to do an analysis, most probably you can find a software or a tool that is available online, or can be further developed by you to fulfill your requirements.\r\n\r\n This is the way that science trajectory is leading to, and to be a successful researcher you need to gain some knowledge and skills in computer programming. \r\n\r\n As a developer for scientific applications, I have the passion and motivation to go further across deciplines and share my knowledge in programming with scientific comunities and developers."}]}}
